This plugin provides the simple functionality of adding the following
batch operations to the template listing screen:

* Link template to theme
* Unlink template to theme

When a template is linked to a theme, its contents are pulled directly 
from the theme itself (residing on the filesystem). In this mode, 
templates do not need to be refreshed. Changes are made in real time.
This is a huge time saver for designers.
